This section explains how the data owner can manage the administrative database. 
It covers some tasks such as adding data, making data available to certain users, 
managing the budget, etc.


To familiarize yourself with this tool, we provide multiple notebooks demonstrating various 
CLI commands that users can use. These notebooks can be found in our 
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/dscc-admin-ch/lomas/tree/master/server/notebooks>`_.

In addition to the notebooks, we also provide a Streamlit application that facilitates these 
administrative tasks.
